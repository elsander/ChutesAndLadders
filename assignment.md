# Practice coding interview assignment (4 hrs)

Simulate a game of Chutes and Ladders (aka Snakes and Ladders). This
game is played on a 10x10 grid (100 squares total). All players start
on square 1 and move by rolling a die during their turn and moving
that many squares forward. At various locations on the board are
ladders, where if you land on one, you move up to a fixed square. If
you land on a square with a chute, you move back down to a fixed
square. 

What is the average amount of time for a player to play the game?

Does it change when there are two players? How about 3? Why?

Given a single game for a single player, what are the probabilities
that the player will land on a square at every step in the game?
